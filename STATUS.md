# relic status

A snapshot of what exists. Not a roadmap: for sequencing see `relic-plan.md`,
for open work see `TODO.md`, for the target design see `specs/architecture.md`.

## Implemented

Nothing yet. The repository holds documentation only.

## Documents

| File | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `specs/architecture.md` | target design, v0.2 |
| `specs/style.md` | code style, binding on all relic-owned code |
| `relic-plan.md` | fifteen stages, six milestones, decision record |
| `initial-spec.md` | the original Draft v1, kept for reference |

## Next

Stage S0, the autotools build skeleton, ending at milestone M0: `./autogen.sh`,
`./configure`, `make`, `make check` and `make distcheck` all succeeding on
macOS and Linux, with a `relic` that prints its version.

## Decisions taken

Recorded as D-1 through D-16 in `relic-plan.md` section 1. The three that
constrain everything else:

* **D-3** tuples are dense arrays of 32-bit interned value identifiers;
* **D-8** the plan representation and the executor exist from S5 and are not
  rewritten by later optimization stages;
* **D-9** the naive evaluator ships in the library as the differential oracle.
